    "text": "This project investigates the feasibility of using common college football quarterback statistics to predict NFL draft outcomes. It focuses on determining whether these statistics can accurately predict whether a quarterback will be drafted and identifying the most significant features influencing draft decisions.\n\n\n\nThe project addresses two main research questions: whether common quarterback statistics can predict NFL draft outcomes, and if so, what features most significantly influence these outcomes. Key elements of the project include:\n\nData Sourcing and Transformation: Data was sourced from college football sports reference pages and normalized within players’ conferences to account for variances in competition levels. A focus was maintained on players who played significant minutes and had a substantial amount of pass attempts.\nModel Development and Evaluation: Different statistical models, including Random Forest and Boosting models, were developed to predict the drafted status of quarterbacks.
